* Motivation

For some time, there has been no such thing as documentation for the
Twine 2 story (and proofing) formats. This document's goal is to
change that.

Like many others, the author of this document was interested in
writing a Twine 2 story format and found that, in nearly every case,
documentation could only be found in the form of code.

This project has no timeline, as this is just a hobby for me and I
don't personally use Twine very frequently, but if you notice
something wrong or out-of-date please open up an issue or, even
better, a pull request. As this is a documentation only project, it's
very simple on GitHub to open a pull request using only the web
interface, simply by hitting the pencil icon at the top right corner
of a file, so any contributions are very appreciated.
